# Terms of Service

## I. General

1\. **Definition of terms**  
By using the Sulitest Impact services and making use of a Sulitest Account (the "Account") and all its related features, (the "Services"), the User agrees to be bound by the following terms of service (the "Terms"). These Terms cover all present and future features provided by the Account. The Services are operated by Sulitest Impact ("Service Provider").

2\. **Agreeing to the terms**  
If the User agrees to these Terms on behalf of a company or another legal entity, the User represents that they have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates, and all Users who access the Services through the Account to these Terms. In the absence of such an authority, the User is not authorized to use the Services.

By using Sulitest tools, you explicitly agree to the recording of your webcam, microphone and screen activity during the test. The data captured is used to maintain the integrity of the assessment process by detecting any possible cheating.
Sharing Information for Cheating Investigations: In the event of a suspected cheating incident, Sulitest may share a limited set of data points with the organization administering the test session. This data may include, but is not limited to, timestamps of suspicious activity, screenshots captured during the assessment, and excerpts from the video or audio recording that demonstrate the suspected behavior.

3\. **Purpose of Data Collection**  
Personal Data: Date of birth, country, gender
This data is collected exclusively for research purposes. It will be processed entirely anonymously, meaning no individual identifier will be associated with this information. The goal of this collection is to analyze the demographic data of users and identify potential correlations with the results obtained during tests.
‍Email Address: Your email address is primarily used to authenticate you and allow you to access your account. It can also be used to send you important notifications about the service, such as updates or information related to your account.
‍Interactions with the device used during the test: The data collected during your interactions with the device (see section 6.3) is essential to ensure fairness for all candidates by monitoring the proper functioning of the service and identifying any potential technical issues.
‍Legitimate Interest: The retention of your data allows us to offer you a better user experience, provide you with a quality service, and meet your needs effectively.

4\. **Definition of cheating:**
Cheating is defined by the use of the following methods when taking TASK:

- Completion of the assessment with collaboration or with the use of external materials or resources.
- Allowing someone to impersonate you while participating in a session or in the completion of an assessment, or impersonating someone else
- Collaboration, discussion, or publishing of assessment questions or answers at any time
- Trying to find vulnerabilities in the system

5\. **How consent is collected:**

Prior to the start of proctored test, users will be prompted to activate their webcam and microphone and must agree to these terms in order to proceed with the test. Without consent, users will not be able to participate in the proctored assessment.
Uers who do not have a webcam or microphone are able to participate in the proctored assessment.

## 6. Assessment administration locations

We offer different types of environments for administering assessments, each designed to meet various testing needs while ensuring security and integrity. Below are descriptions of the three types of locations where assessments may be conducted
‍

1. In-Class Assessment  
    In-class assessments are conducted in traditional educational settings, such as classrooms within schools, universities, or training centers.

   - Supervision: These assessments are overseen by a person present in the room to monitor the candidates throughout the test to ensure compliance with exam rules and prevent cheating.
   - Setting: Candidates are physically present in a group, seated in a structured layout that facilitates supervision. There are no special proctoring tools such as cameras or microphones required, as the invigilator ensures that test integrity is maintained.
     ‍

2. Controlled Environment Assessment (Empty Room with Camera)
   Controlled environment assessments are administered in a designated, isolated room specifically prepared for testing.

   - Supervision: The room is equipped with fixed surveillance cameras to monitor the entire space.

   - Setting: Candidates take the test in an empty room where no one else is present. The room is free of external distractions or resources, and its design is intended to prevent any form of cheating.
     This environment is highly secure and minimizes the risk of external interference, providing a stringent level of control over the testing process.
     ‍

3. Remotely Proctored Assessment
   Remotely proctored assessments allow candidates to complete their tests from any location, such as their home, office, or other personal spaces.

   - Supervision: Remote proctoring tools, such as webcams, microphones, and screen monitoring software, are used to observe the candidate throughout the test in real-time. Proctors or automated systems watch for suspicious behavior to ensure the candidate follows the rules.
   - Setting: Candidates take the test on their personal computers or devices. They are required to activate their webcam and microphone, and their screen is recorded to ensure they do not access unauthorized resources or receive outside assistance.

   This setup provides flexibility for candidates while ensuring the test remains secure through remote surveillance technologies.

4. Exam conditions
   The candidate is responsible for ensuring optimal testing conditions for the entire duration of the test. This includes, but is not limited to:

   - Absence of auditory distractions
   - Physical isolation
   - Adequate lighting
   - An unobstructed and properly positioned device camera (if applicable)
